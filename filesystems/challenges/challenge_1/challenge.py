# This challenge uses what you've learned in Filesystems Modules 1-8.
#
# OBJECTIVE:
#
# Write a script that, in this directory, creates the following nested
# folder structure:
#
# ./dir_a/dir_b/dir_c
#
# In each directory (i.e. each of dir_a, dir_b, and dir_c) create a file 
# matching the following naming pattern:
#
#  data_<a/b/c/etc.>.txt
#
# Do not write data to the file. Likewise, the script should check to make
# sure that each file and directory created are not overwritten/re-created
# if they already exist.
#
#
# HELP:
#
# Methods such as .split() for string, data structures such as lists/arrays,
# and Python's builtin for files (the open() builtin) will help here! Also
# use the tests to help! If you need to reset this challenge, run the reset
# script. Good luck!
