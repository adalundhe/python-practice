# python-practice
A repo containing practice exercises for common Python modules.

# Setup

These exercises require Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. For MacOS, we recommend PyEnv and brew, with instructions here - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-in-macos.

If you'd prefer to use your system's default python, you'll need to run all scripts with:

```
python3 <script_name>
```

Note that these exercises <i>only</i> use builtin Python modules.


# How To:

Each learning "area" is broken up into modules. Each module is self-contained, and modules should be followed in order. All files required to run or complete
a given module are included within the module as well, so no worries on creating
any addition files or having to do any additional setup!

Challenges are self-contained like modules, but encompass combining some or all of what you learned in a section's modules. 

Challenges may also push you to research and learn aspects of features of Python outside of the scope of the modules. However, any new information introduced or potentially useful to a challenge will be denoted in the <b>HELP</b> section of the `challenge.py` file for that challenge.

Each challenge contains:
- `challenge.py`: The challenge file where you should implement your solution.
- `challenge_solution.py`: Detailed step-by-step solution including runnable code and debug statements.
- `tests.py`: Quick tests/checks making sure the output of your solution matches what's expected.
- `reset.py`: resets that challenge, including all existing files and or files/directories/data/etc. you've created. This means existing files or data being reverted to their original state, and any files or data you've created being lost. However, any changes you've made to that challenge's `challenge.py` file will <i>not</i> be reverted.

Challenges are designed to push you by presenting questions closer to what you might find in an actual interview but still remain a fun learning experience. Try to avoid reading the solution until you've spent a good bit of time trying, and use thr tests to guide the code you write!
