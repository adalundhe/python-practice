# python-practice
A repo containing practice exercises for common Python modules.

# Setup

These exercises require Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. For MacOS, we recommend PyEnv and brew, with instructions here - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-in-macos.

If you'd prefer to use your system's default python, you'll need to run all scripts with:

```
python3 <script_name>
```

Note that these exercises <i>only</i> use builtin Python modules.


# How To:

Each learning "area" is broken up into modules. Each module is self-contained, and modules should be followed in order. All files required to run or complete
a given module are included within the module as well, so no worries on creating
any addition files or having to do any additional setup!
